## INDEPENDENT AI/EDUCATION PROJECTS (2025–present)

Developing open-source tools at the intersection of AI and K-12 governance, driven by direct experience as a school board director.

- Built a **WA State Education Data MCP Server** (Python/MCP protocol) providing AI-friendly access to Washington State standardized assessment data across districts, student groups, grades, and years -- designed for multi-district use and compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients | *github.com/lisaguthrie/wa-ed-mcp*
- Developed a **School Improvement Plan Dashboard** (Python/React/Claude API) that transforms hundreds of pages of unstructured district PDF documents into structured, searchable data with AI-powered Q&A -- enabling board directors to shift SIP review from a compliance exercise to meaningful oversight; implemented prompt caching for ~90% cost reduction on repeat runs | *github.com/lisaguthrie/sipdashboard*
