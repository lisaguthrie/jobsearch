## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**MICROSOFT**

**Principal Technical Program Manager** -- Redmond, WA (October 2020 - May 2025)

Embedded with DevDiv executive leadership as internal product builder and problem solver. Identified operational bottlenecks across a 2000-person engineering organization, diagnosed root causes, and shipped solutions -- from prototyping tools to facilitating cross-functional teams to hands-on technical work. Focused on enabling velocity with existing resources rather than requesting budget or headcount.

* Inherited quarterly exec review that consumed 30+ hours chasing PMs for product updates. Redesigned document structure to pull directly from existing OKR tracking tool (Viva Goals), supplemented with marketing materials and AI-assisted content synthesis. Shipped restructured approach in single review cycle without additional budget or formal approval. Cut collation time 70% while maintaining positive exec feedback.
* Took over quarterly EVP review process, noticed we were optimizing for "the EVP expects this format" rather than efficiency. Experimented with small format changes, saw no pushback, shipped bigger redesign aligned to existing OKRs. Worst case was "EVP hates it and I look bad," not mission-critical failure. Validated through division-level reviews. Result: Cut collation time 70% while maintaining positive exec feedback.
* Streamlined org-wide communications in collaboration with a cross-functional v-team, providing technical assistance and automation that reduced email volume and operational churn.

Increased overall usage by over 150% and increased paid usage from 0% to 65% within 6 months of GA.
