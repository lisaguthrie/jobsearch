 ## Leadership WSSDA (in progress)
Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, the Leadership WSSDA program has shaped over 200 school directors into stronger leaders. Designed for school directors with at least two years of experience, Leadership WSSDA helps participants deepen their personal and professional capacity for leadership.

Participants will enjoy highly engaging, place-based learning that connects them with state and local leaders. Graduates of the program have become leaders at the state level themselves, serving on WSSDA committees, the WSSDA Board of Directors, and even in the Legislature. Ten graduates have gone on to become WSSDA presidents.

### Take Your Leadership to the Next Level
The Leadership WSSDA program provides the time and framework to examine today’s most important education issues with other experienced school board members. There is very little lecture time. Participants will be up and moving, engaging with each other in one-on-one discussions, group activities, and actively learning. The curriculum may also include reading articles and books between classes to enrich discussion around current education and leadership topics.

### For Experienced Board Members
Leadership WSSDA is for school directors with at least two years of school board experience. Those with fewer than two years on their board are not eligible to apply for this program. Instead, newer school board members are encouraged to participate in WSSDA’s Board Boot Camp and OnBoard professional learning opportunities. Also, serving on a WSSDA committee is a great way to build experience.

### 2026 Schedule and Topics
Participants will enjoy visits by expert speakers and field trips to facilitate in-depth learning. School directors admitted to the program will need to commit to all five sessions, though exceptions could occur in rare circumstances.

The program starts with two sessions that lay a foundation for thinking and learning about leadership together, and then we travel to new locations around the state for our third and fourth sessions. Our final session is at Annual Conference.

Each session starts midday on a Thursday and concludes midday on Friday:

**Leadership to Learn, Leadership to Educate**
